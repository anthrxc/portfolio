# Portfolio Website

This is a redesign of my personal portfolio website, with some improved design and updated bio, projects list and a proper contact form.  
Inspiration (if you stretch the definition far enough) from my [old website](https://github.com/anthrxc/personal-website) and [Riccardo Zanutta](https://riccardozanutta.com/).
